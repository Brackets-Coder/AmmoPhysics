# Ammo Physics

A work-in-progress Turbowarp extension based on the ammo.js physics library, which is based on the C++ Bullet Physics SDK.

The goal is to provide feature-complete, advanced, and performant 3D physics in a simple-to-understand manner. This extension aims to be consistent with the Box2D and Simple3D extensions.
