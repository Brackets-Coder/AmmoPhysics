# Ammo Physics

A work-in-progress Turbowarp extension based on the ammo.js physics library, which is based on the C++ Bullet Physics SDK.

The goal is to provide feature-complete, advanced, and performant 3D physics in a simple-to-understand manner. This extension aims to be consistent with the Box2D and Simple3D extensions.
**_This extension is still a work in progress and should not be used._**

## What I'm working on
- Raycasting Rewrite
- Optimization
- Bug fixing
- Triangle Mesh Support

## Task list:
- [ ] All shape types:
    - [x] Boxes
    - [x] Spheres
    - [x] Cylinders
    - [x] Cones
    - [x] Capsules
    - ~~Planes~~
    - [x] Convex Hulls
    - [ ] Triangle Meshes
    - [x] Compound bodies
- [x] Physical Materials (friction, restitution, etc.)
- [ ] Constraints (All types)
- [ ] Collision:
    - [x] Collision Detection
    - [x] Raycasting
    - [ ] Enable/disable collision response
- [x] Manual Impact forces (like "push with force" block in Box2D)
- Player Management?
- Vehicle support?
- Soft bodies?
